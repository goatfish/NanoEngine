# NanoEngine

NanoEngine is a small C++ DX11 MVP (minimum viable product) 3D game engine and editor. It's meant to be built into what a project needs rather than trying to be all things to all people. I'm actively developing the engine for a 0.1 version sometime in early in 2021. The goal of the first release is only to be usable as an tool for prototyping game ideas.

A roadmap will be forthcoming but the initial versions will be for 64-bit Windows and DirectX 11. It will include a scene editor, a few demos, basic shaders, lights, cameras, built in primative meshes and mesh importing. It includes ImGUI so in-game UI will also use that to start. Math will be reliant on DirectXMath library.
